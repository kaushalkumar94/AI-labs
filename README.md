# AI-labs

This repository contains the lab work, code, and assignments for my Artificial Intelligence course. Each folder corresponds to a specific lab, covering different AI concepts and algorithms.

---

## [lab1](./lab1) - Uninformed Search Algorithms

This lab focuses on basic uninformed search strategies.
* `8ppBFS.cpp`: Solves the 8-Puzzle Problem using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
* `8ppDFS.cpp`: Solves the 8-Puzzle Problem using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.
* `water_jug_problem.cpp`: An implementation of the classic **Water Jug Problem**.

---

## [lab2](./lab2) - Local Search & Heuristic Algorithms

This lab explores local search and heuristic-based algorithms.
* `eightPuzzleUsingHillClimbing.cpp`: Solves the 8-Puzzle Problem using the **Hill Climbing** algorithm.
* `magicSquare.cpp`: A program to solve the **Magic Square** problem.
* `tictactoe1.cpp`: A basic implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
* `water_jug_problem.cpp`: Another approach to the **Water Jug Problem**.

---

## [lab3](./lab3) - A* Search Algorithm

This lab implements the A\* (A-star) informed search algorithm.
* `AstarProblem.cpp`: A C++ implementation of the **A\* search algorithm**, likely applied to a problem like the 8-puzzle.
* `AstarAlgorithm.md`: Documentation and explanation of the A\* algorithm.

---

## [lab4](./lab4) - Game Playing (Minimax)

This lab introduces adversarial search algorithms for game playing.
* `tictactoeMiniMax.cpp`: An implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe that uses the **Minimax algorithm** to determine the optimal move.

---

## [lab5](./lab5) - Adversarial Search Optimizations

This lab builds on game-playing algorithms with more advanced techniques.
* `alphaBetaPruning.py`: Implements the **Alpha-Beta Pruning** optimization for the Minimax algorithm.
* `AOstart.py`: An implementation of the **AO\* algorithm** for AND-OR graphs.

---

## [lab6](./lab6) - Planning

This lab covers AI planning problems.
* `BlockWord.py`: A Python program to solve the **Blocks World problem**, a classic automated planning scenario.

---

## [lab8](./lab8) - LISP Programming

This lab served as an introduction to programming in **LISP (List Processing)**.
* The `.md` files in this folder contain the LISP code snippets and explanations.
* The code was written and executed using an [online Common Lisp compiler](https://onecompiler.com/commonlisp).
